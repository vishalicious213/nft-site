# NFT Site

This was a Scrimba project. It focused on using semantic HTML elements in place of standard containers - especially \<div>'s, margin properties (and quirks like how when a parent and child element touch, their margins can collapse into each other and how heading element margins can push out past their parent containers), hover and active states and the reason to use active states (its for accessibility & e-reader support), container elements, organizing CSS, CSS specificity, grouping CSS selectors, compound selectors, main classes and modifier classes, and finally buttons vs links (buttons should be used for actions and links for navigation, even though links can be styled to look like buttons - again, this is an accessibility concern).

I built out the page but customized how my CSS and HTML were set up and optimized. In some cases, I chose not to over-optimize the CSS to be DRY (essentially repeating some lines of code) because it added to readability. After the project was complete, I enhanced it by making it responsive, so its viewable on mobile screens without forcing horizontal scrolling.
